"""Payload shapes of the production module (ex `routes/production.py`).

Launching, job queue, declensions, NSFW arming.

WHY THE NUMBERS ARE TYPED `int | str | None` AND NOT `int`.

`create.js payload()` reads them straight off `<input>.value`, so they travel as
STRINGS — and as the EMPTY STRING whenever the settings panel has not been
painted yet, which is the case on the very first `refreshPlan()` fired by
`renderScenes()`. `entier()` has always absorbed that: `if v in (None, ""):
return None`.

Declaring `count: int | None` would therefore answer 400 to every first plan of
every session. And declaring `ge=1, le=24` would answer 400 to `count=9999`,
which must still come back 200 with a plan of 24 images — the server bound is a
CLAMP, not a validation (test_serveur_http, case [M9]).

So the schema documents the wire type honestly and `clamped_int()` keeps doing
the coercion, the clamping and the French rejection message it always did.
