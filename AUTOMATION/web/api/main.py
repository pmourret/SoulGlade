"""Assembly of the FastAPI application: middleware, error handlers, routers,
static files. No business logic here — the same rule `web/app.py` followed
under aiohttp.

ONE PROCESS, ONE WORKER. `shared_state.STATE`, `UNDO` and `CHECKER` (~1 GB of
InsightFace) are process globals; see the module docstring of shared_state.py
for what `--workers > 1` would break. `web/app.py` hands the app OBJECT to
`uvicorn.run`, which makes the multi-worker mode technically unavailable — that
is the enforcement, not just a convention.

OPENAPI. /docs (Swagger) and /openapi.json are served in development. This is
the first time the API contract exists as something machine-readable: it used
to live in docstrings and in the JS that consumed it (AUDIT §7.8). The React
frontend generates its TypeScript types from that document
(AUTOMATION/tools/dump_openapi.py), so no payload shape is written by hand twice.

FRONTEND. React + TypeScript, built by AUTOMATION/tools/toolchain.py and served
by api/spa.py — which also carries the SPA fallback for the router's deep links.

    # Registration order is INVERTED at runtime: the last one added is the
    # outermost. So the origin guard runs first — a text/plain body is turned
    # away with 415 before a single byte of it is read — and the size limit
    # wraps everything below it, where the body actually gets consumed.
