"""Rules of the scene bank: what a save may contain, and what it may lose.

THE HEART IS `validate_scene_bank`, and it did not move an inch. It is
imperative, it returns French sentences, and each of its rules carries a dated
incident. Turning it into a declarative Pydantic model was tempting and would
have been wrong — it validates a FILE that belongs to the character, not a
request payload, and it is also called with the PREVIOUS version of that file
to compare the two.

That comparison is the point: the 25/08/2026 regression was not a malformed
scene, it was sixteen well-formed scenes quietly stripped of their creative
keys in a single save. Losing one scene's metadata is an edit; losing them in
a batch never is.

The rest is what the Créer screen's cards read (`scene_stats`,
`scene_previews`), the rotating backup that makes a bad save recoverable, and
the sort key that stopped an unmigrated bank from coming out as a 400
(`category_order`).

No HTTP here: the router catches the returned problems and decides the status.
