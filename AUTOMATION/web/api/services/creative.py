"""Rules of the creative tiers — what a level ALLOWS, and at what cost.

Everything here reads `creative.json` through `lb.load_creative` /
`lb.by_level` and answers one question: given the requested level, what does
the server let through, and how must the configuration be bent before the
runner sees it.

WHY IT IS NOT IN THE RUNNER. `lb.execute_jobs` has no business knowing about
intensity tiers (§8.2: one execution core, and it stays generic). The tier is a
POLICY read above it: the guard refuses, the export rule cuts, the two-pass
chaining rewrites the level — then the runner is handed a plain configuration
it can execute without knowing why.

WHY IT IS NOT IN THE ROUTER EITHER. Three routes apply these rules
(/api/plan, /api/run, /api/decline) and the batch service applies them again
on the second pass. A rule that lives in one route ends up half-applied by the
others — which is exactly how, on 24/08/2026, level 2 images were landing in
PROD/EXPORT.

The messages returned are French: they are displayed as-is.

    requested one: at the tier that edits, the generation pass runs at
