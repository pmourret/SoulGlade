"""Bookkeeping of a sort: the database row, the export, the NSFW journal.

Moving a file between buckets is three gestures, and only the first one is
visible. The other two are here, because each has already been got wrong once:

  - THE DATABASE ROW must carry the RIGHT character. Both `base.py` calls
    default to 'lena' (J2 compatibility), so sorting another character's image
    used to write a `character_id='lena'` row into the single shared database.
    It stayed clean only because nobody had yet sorted another character from
    the Review. `character_id` is mandatory here, always.
  - THE EXPORT is looked up under the name the image is RECORDED under in the
    journal, which a collision rename separates from the file's own name.
    Reading the journal with the final name returned an empty row — hence
    `categorie = divers`, `format = 4:5`, an export in the wrong folder and a
    9:16 image resized to 1080x1350.
  - TAKING AN IMAGE OUT of publication sweeps THIS character's export folder
    only: an rglob over all of PROD/EXPORT/ deleted another character's
    homonymous file along with it (`nom_libre` only guarantees uniqueness
    inside one PROD/<CID>/ tree).

None of this may ever make a sort fail: when these run, the file has already
moved on disk. They log and carry on.
