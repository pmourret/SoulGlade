"""Launching generation, job queue, declensions.

Port of `routes/production.py` — same 6 URLs, same JSON bodies, same status
codes.

    /api/plan               dry run, replayed on every keystroke
    /api/run                launches a batch — generation OR edit, one entry
    /api/decline            short loop from an image already produced
    /api/stop               arms STATE["stop"]
    /api/nsfw/instructions  the graph's real preamble + instruction history
    /api/nsfw/arm           arms/disarms the CHARACTER's NSFW switch

WHAT DID NOT MOVE, AND MUST NOT. There is a single execution core,
`lb.execute_jobs`, called by the CLI and by the web (CLAUDE.md §8.2); a single
launch path, `start_batch`, shared by /api/run and /api/decline; and a single
run state, `ss.STATE`. Every ComfyUI call underneath stays blocking urllib
pushed into an executor, with `wait_prompt()` polling /history every 2 s — no
websocket, and `ui_to_api.convert()` still reconverts the UI workflow on every
launch (CLAUDE.md §8.1). This module never touches any of that; it hands jobs
to the runner and reports.

    the handler had to `await request.json()` first on purpose: `await` hands
    control back to the loop, so testing STATE before reading let two concurrent
    requests both pass the test and launch two batches on the same GPU. FastAPI
    now parses the body before the handler is even entered, so the order holds
    by construction — but only as long as NO `await` is introduced between the
    `STATE["running"]` test below and the call to `start_batch`. Everything in
    between is deliberately synchronous.
