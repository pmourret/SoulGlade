/* Keyboard mechanics for one radiogroup of mutually exclusive choices — a
   generic UI-kit hook (like Icon.tsx, Dialog.tsx), not chrome-specific:
   first used by the wizard's type/style/world cards and candidate grid
   (screen-1-wizard design pass), promoted here once Produire needed the
   exact same mechanics for its intensity/quality/tone/intention groups
   (screen-3-produire) — frontend.md: shared by two, owned by neither.

   Arrows move the selection AND pick it immediately, same as a native radio
   group; Home/End jump to the ends. `tabIndexFor` keeps exactly one Tab stop
   per group: the active choice, or the first item while nothing is picked
   yet.

   FOCUS FOLLOWS `activeId`, NEVER THE KEY PRESS ITSELF (found live,
   screen-3-produire audit): the intensity list's `onPick` (ProduceSidebar)
   can open a confirmation
   dialog and never actually change the level if the user cancels it — an
   eager `.focus()` on the "next" button right after `onKeyDown` left focus
   on a button `aria-checked="false"`, visibly disconnected from the real
   selection. Focus is moved by an effect keyed on `activeId` instead, and
   only when it fires while focus is ALREADY somewhere inside this group —
   that is exactly "a keyboard move that took effect"; a cancelled one
   leaves `activeId` unchanged, so the effect never runs, and the dialog's
   own focus-restore (chrome/Dialog.tsx) puts focus back on the original,
   still-correct button instead. A programmatic change from outside the
   group (or one back-to-back so fast the group never got focus) does not
   steal focus, because `document.activeElement` will not be one of its own
   nodes at that moment. */
