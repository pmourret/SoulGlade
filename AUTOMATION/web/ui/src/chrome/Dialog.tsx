/* Modal dialog primitive — native <dialog>, no library.
   Ported from `static/ui-dialog.js`, same contract:

     - `showModal()`, so the browser gives the top layer, the backdrop and the
       focus trap for free;
     - focus moves into the box on open and is restored to the element that
       opened it on close;
     - Escape is handled natively (the `cancel` event);
     - a click on the backdrop closes it when the box allows it — the event
       target is the <dialog> itself, never a child, which is how the two are
       told apart.

   Rebuilt as a component rather than a function that takes a node: the box's
   CONTENT is now JSX owned by its caller, instead of an innerHTML string
   injected into a single shared `#armCard`. The legacy frontend had one dialog
   element reused by the confirm, the NSFW arming and the decline modal, and
   whoever wrote into it last owned it. */
