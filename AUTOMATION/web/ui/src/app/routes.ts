/* THE route table. One place, like `static/constants.js` was — never a path

   WHAT CHANGES FROM THE LEGACY FRONTEND (migration brief, point 2). Hash routing
   is gone: every screen has a real path. The two screens that used to switch
   behaviour through an attribute get distinct routes instead of that switch —
   `#registre[data-vue]` becomes /characters (the entry gate) and /character (the
   sheet); `#trier[data-metier]` becomes /review (judging the A_REVOIR queue) and
   /gallery (consulting the kept ones). Same behaviour for the user, two honest
   URLs. Sub-views that already had a composed hash keep their shape as a path:
   `#scenes/poses` -> /bank/poses.

   Paths are in English, like the rest of the new code. UI copy stays French. */
