/* The skeleton editor's own work surface: an SVG rendering of a PoseFrame,
   each joint a draggable circle. No canvas library — react-konva was looked
   at and set aside (studio decision, 2026-09-01): the actual interaction is
   simpler than it sounds. "Rotate a limb" is just moving ONE endpoint while
   the connecting line's OTHER end (the parent joint) stays put — nothing
   here needs a real rotation transform, just redrawing a line between two
   points on every frame.

   DRAG PATTERN copied from PhotoEditor.tsx's crop-handle code (same studio,
   same problem: a pointer's screen-pixel movement has to become a delta in
   the SURFACE's own coordinate space, not the page's). The SVG equivalent of
   PhotoEditor's `displayScale()` is `getScreenCTM().inverse()` — the
   standard way to turn a client (mouse) point into the SVG's own
   `viewBox` units regardless of how large the element is drawn on screen.

   MODIFIER KEYS, one meaning each, chosen to never collide (2026-09-02):
     Shift + drag a JOINT       -> IK-style rotate (preserve bone length)
     Shift + drag the BACKGROUND -> rectangle-select
     Ctrl/Cmd + click a JOINT   -> toggle it in/out of the selection
   Shift already meant two different things depending on target (joint vs
   background) before multi-select existed; Ctrl/Cmd was free and matches
   the OS-standard "toggle one item" convention, so toggling never has to
   guess whether a still Shift+click was a selection gesture or the start of
   an IK drag that just didn't move yet. */
