   direct child of a single combined scroll+relative stage, drifted off
   past the edge of the viewport after a few zoom-in clicks, because it
   was positioned against the ever-growing SCROLLABLE CONTENT box, not
   the visible viewport. STAGE_SCROLL is the actual `overflow-auto`

   zoom-in clicks the crop frame measured at NEGATIVE viewport coordinates,
   hundreds of pixels off. `margin:auto` on CANVAS_WRAP below centers it
   the exact same way at "fit" (free space still gets absorbed by the auto
   margins) WITHOUT that scroll-anchor quirk — auto-margin centering isn't
