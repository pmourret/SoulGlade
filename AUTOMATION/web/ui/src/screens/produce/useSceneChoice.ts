/* Which scenes the current level makes available, and in which order.

   TWO RULES THAT COME FROM THE SERVER, AND ARE NOT REIMPLEMENTED HERE.

   The BAND of a scene arrives in `bank.meta`: the server applies the same
   compatibility defaults as the runner, so the frontend reads a band rather
   than deriving one. A second derivation would drift the day the defaults move.

   The LEVEL consulted is the GENERATION level, not the displayed one. On the
   editing tier the chain runs in two steps — generate at `base_level` (Soft)
   then edit — so asking for the scenes of level 3 empties the grid: no scene
   declares band 3. `payload_at_generation_level()` applies the same rule on the
   server.

   THE TONE REMOVES NOTHING. It lifts the scenes that suit it to the top. Hard
   filtering led to dead ends — lifestyle + elegant returned zero scene, and an
   empty grid says « nothing exists » when it means « nothing matches ».

   SEARCH AND SORT (screen-3-produire design pass, §S) — client-side only,
   over the SAME `scenesOf(intent)` list: a substring match on the scene id,
   and a sort key that REPLACES the tone-affinity order rather than fighting
   it (affinity is itself one of the choices, and the default). Neither
   touches `scenesOf`: a shorter, reordered `visibleScenes` is exactly what
   the grid renders, nothing else reads this list. */
