/* The Produire screen's own state, and the plan that follows it.
   Ported from `static/create.js`.

   COUPLING TRAP §5.6-2 — /api/plan is replayed on every keystroke, behind a
   debounce. It carries THREE things at once: the count, the prompt preview and
   the instruction alerts. Nothing here batches it away or replaces it with a
   local computation: the assembly of the prompt lives on the server, and a
   second implementation in the frontend is exactly what the preview exists to
   avoid.

   COUPLING TRAP §5.6-3 — `#btnRun.disabled`. Two timers used to write it: the
   1.5 s production tick and refreshPlan(). `planOk()` was the common source that
   kept them from fighting, and it is documented on the backend side as
   AUDIT.md §5.6. Here `planOk` is derived state and the button's disabled
   attribute is ONE expression, computed in one place from (planOk, running,
   comfy) — the two writers cannot exist any more, so neither can the bug the
   guard covered. The guard survives as that single expression; see
   `runDisabled` below. */
