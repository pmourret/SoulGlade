/* The current character, as SHARED REACT STATE.

   WHAT CHANGES FROM THE LEGACY FRONTEND (migration brief, point 1). `?character=`
   used to be read once at load time and changing character meant reloading the
   whole page (V1 contract, CLAUDE.md §9). Here the id is state: switching
   re-renders, it does not reload. The query parameter stays in the URL so a link
   is still bookmarkable and shareable — but it is now a MIRROR of the state, not
   the trigger. The one place the URL still leads is a real navigation the user
   made: back/forward, or a pasted link. The effect below covers exactly that case.

   WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE. The three creation axes (type, output style, world) are
   frozen at creation and the pack is derived from them (CLAUDE.md §3, §8.8):
   nothing here edits a sheet, and no route exists to. This context READS.

   `claimed` is null on the entry gate — no character is claimed, so no
   `?character=` goes out and the server applies its own default. `sheet` is the
   loaded character's record, or null while it is in flight. */

         (back, forward, a pasted link). Adopt it.
       - it names NOBODY while a character is loaded -> an internal navigation
         dropped the query. Every `<Link to="/character">` does exactly that,
